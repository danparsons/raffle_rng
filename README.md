Summary:
========
PRAW 4 is a reddit bot that replies to mentions with a random integer within the limits defined by the comment that calls the bot. 

If the bot is mentioned like this: /u/botname 30 it will reply with a number between 1 and 30.
By default that text is: "The winner is: N"
  
If the bot is mentioned like this: /u/botname blah it will reply with the contents of error_reply.
By default that text is: "Call the bot like this: /u/botname 20"
